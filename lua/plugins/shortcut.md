# Notes about some shortcuts I need to train myself to use more often with my distribution of lazyvim

## Subtitution

- s<motion>: replace motion with text in cliboard/register

- <leader>s<motion1><motion2>: replace text in motion1 with a text inputted later. motion2 is the scope of the replacement
  - motion1 can be selected by visual
  - example: <leader>siwif : replace all the word under the cursor which occured in current function, with the text inputted
